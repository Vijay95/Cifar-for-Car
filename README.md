# Tensorflow
It has the details of the way to pass the data we wish to pass into Tensorflow graph (CifarNet in Specific) <br/>
It contains of codes which can be used to prepare data. <br/>
The steps to use the codes and the prerequisites to run the code are listed here 

## Data Preparation
1) Image_to_h5py converts the images from the standard formats(like jpeg,png) to h5py formats <br/>
(This is very important if you can't call all python packages in the environment where you have informed the <br/> 
[Note:

## Training
cifar_train.py is the code to be executed which uses the functions in cifar10.py and cifar10_input.py
